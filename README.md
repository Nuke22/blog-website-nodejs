# blog-website-nodejs
This is the project where I'm trying hard to master nodejs + ejs + express via building blog website. 
This stuff has no DB, so it's more like dummy. Maby later on I will add it, but idk^)

If you want to recreate my project, please consider, 
that you have to use <code>npm install</code> in order to add dependencies to the project.
